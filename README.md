# Dams_US

Dams stand as pivotal infrastructural assets in the United States of America (US), instrumental in
driving economic growth and meeting various societal needs with different uses such as flood control, irrigation, hydropower generation, and water supply. Understanding their spatial distribution
patterns is essential for effective water management, environmental conservation, and disaster risk
reduction. In this context, this project aims to delve into the spatial dynamics of dams within
USA.
The main objective of this investigation is to answer the following research question: What are the spatial distribution patterns of dams in the USA? And how different approaches to defining spatial relationships can influence the assessment of spatial autocorrelation and subsequent spatial analysis outcomes?
